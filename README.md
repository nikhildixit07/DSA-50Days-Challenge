# 🚀 DSA 50 Days Challenge

Welcome to my **50 Days of DSA Challenge**, where I solve Data Structures & Algorithms problems every day to build consistency, logic, and problem-solving skills. This Coding Challenge was organized by VIT Bhopal placement cell under the #DrGViswanathanChallenge initiative.
All solutions are organized day-wise in 10-day grouped folders for neat navigation and progress tracking.

## 📄 File Naming Convention

Each solution file in this repository follows the naming format:

```DayDD QP LeetCode ProblemID.ext```

### Breakdown of the format:

| Component | Meaning |
|----------|----------|
| **DayDD** | Represents the challenge day → (Day01, Day14, Day37, ...) |
| **QP** | Question number solved on that day → (Q1, Q2, Q3 if multiple) |
| **LeetCode ProblemID** | The exact LeetCode problem ID used → (LeetCode 258, LeetCode 876, etc.) |
| **ext** | File format → (.py, .cpp, .java, etc.) |

### 📝 Example Files Explained

| Filename | Meaning |
|----------|----------|
| `Day01 Q1 LeetCode 258.py` | Day 01 → 1st Question → LeetCode #258 → Python solution |
| `Day01 Q2 LeetCode 876.py` | Day 01 → 2nd Problem → LeetCode #876 → Python |
